Hi HN, we're Marc and Matt, and we're building Propolis (app.propolis.tech/#/launch). We use browser agents to simulate users in order to report bugs and write e2e tests. Today, you can launch 10s-100s of agents that collaboratively explore a website and report back on pain points + propose e2e tests that can run as part of your CI. You can try an initial run (two minute set up) to get a feel for the product for free here: app.propolis.tech/#/launch. Or watch our demo video: https://www.tella.tv

## Summary

Researchers at Nvidia have developed a novel approach to train large language models (LLMs) in 4-bit quantized format while maintaining their stability and accuracy at the level of high-precision mode

## Content

Researchers at Nvidia have developed a novel approach to train large language models (LLMs) in 4-bit quantized format while maintaining their stability and accuracy at the level of high-precision models. Their technique, NVFP4, makes it possible to train models that not only outperform other leading 4-bit formats but match the performance of the larger 8-bit FP8 format, all while using half the memory and a fraction of the compute. The success of NVFP4 shows that enterprises can continue to cut

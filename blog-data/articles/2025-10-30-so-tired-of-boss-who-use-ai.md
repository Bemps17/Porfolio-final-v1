## Content

My boss just sent me a folder with like ten different files. Technical descriptions, test scripts, and a bunch of summaries all made by AI. All of that just so I could add a simple POST request to a new API endpoint on our site. He probably spent hours prompting AI output when the API’s own docs literally gave me everything I needed in a minute. Anyone else dealing with a boss like this? I’d love to hear your stories. submitted by /u/Poutine-StJean [link] [comments]

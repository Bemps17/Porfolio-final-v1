Unlike PR-review bots, we try to flag not just by &quot;is it a bug?&quot; but by &quot;is it worth a second look?&quot; (examples: hard-coded secret, weird crypto mode, gnarly logic, ugly code).To try it, replace github.com with 0github.com in any pull-request URL. Under the hood, we split the PR into individual files, and for each file, we ask an LLM to annotate each line with a data structure that we parse into a colored heatmap.Examples:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0github.com&#x2F;manaflow-ai&#x2F;cmux&#x2F;pull&#x2F;666https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0github.com&#x2F;stack-auth&#x2F;stack-auth&#x2F;pull&#x2F;988https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0github.com&#x2F;tinygrad&#x2F;tinygrad&#x2F;pull&#x2F;12995https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0github.com&#x2F;simonw&#x2F;datasette&#x2F;pull&#x2F;2548Notice how all the example links have a 0 prepended before github.com. This navigates you to our custom diff viewer where we handle the same URL path parameters as github.com. Darker yellows indicate that an area might require more investigation. Hover on the highlights to see the LLM&#x27;s explanation. There&#x27;s also a slider on the top left to adjust the &quot;should review&quot; threshold.Repo (MIT license): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;manaflow-ai&#x2F;cmux",

My usage of AI with copilot was always like a better intllisence, I know what I want to write but sometimes it's lot of typing and copilot will give me that shortcut.

I am trying now to code without it, and suddenly I become more relaxed, in a way it became like TikTok / Reels, keep pushing changes in your face, flashy screens and turn coding for me from a relaxing thing to a stressful one. Things keep flashing in my eyes, everything moves. It's just a text editor, it shouldn't behave that way. I will give the new approach a try, turning it off as default and then turning it on when I am doing ordinary things, template code or long typing, we'll see how it go.",

      "content": "Please don't roast me for wanting to share this, but I've been learning more about newer react hooks and remembered when I knew no other hooks than `useState` and `useEffect` lol. I am not here to judge, I am here to help spread the knowledge with a few hooks I have became way more familiar and comfortable with! Here is a reminder for all the hooks you don't use but probably should! # useMemo: The \"I already did it\" hook `useMemo` helps prevent unnecessary re-computation of values between renders. It’s perfect for expensive functions or large array operations that depend on stable inputs. ``` const filteredData = useMemo(() =&gt; { return thousandsOfDataPoints.filter((item) =&gt; item.isImportant &amp;&amp; item.isMassive); }, [thousandsOfDataPoints]); ``` Without `useMemo`, React would re-run this filtering logic **every render**, even when `thousandsOfDataPoints` hasn’t changed. With it, React only recalculates when `thousandsOfDataPoints` changes — saving you cycles and keeping components snappy. The takes away, use useMemo for large datasets that don't really change often. Think retrieving a list of data for processing. # useCallback: The \"Don't do it unless I tell you\" to hook `useCallback` prevents unnecessary re-renders caused by unstable function references. This becomes essential when passing callbacks down to memorized child components. ``` import React, { useState, useCallback, memo } from \"react\"; const TodoItem = memo(({ todo, onToggle }) =&gt; { console.log(\"Rendered:\", todo.text); return ( &lt;li&gt; &lt;label&gt; &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" checked={todo.completed} onChange={() =&gt; onToggle(todo.id)} /&gt; {todo.text} &lt;/label&gt; &lt;/li&gt; ); }); export default function TodoList() { const [todos, setTodos] = useState([ { id: 1, text: \"Write blog post\", completed: false }, { id: 2, text: \"Refactor components\", completed: false }, ]); // useCallback keeps 'onToggle' stable between renders const handleToggle = useCallback((id: number) =&gt; { setTodos((prev) =&gt; prev.map((t) =&gt; t.id === id ? { ...t, completed: !t.completed } : t ) ); }, []); return ( &lt;ul&gt; {todos.map((todo) =&gt; ( &lt;TodoItem key={todo.id} todo={todo} onToggle={handleToggle} /&gt; ))} &lt;/ul&gt; ); } ``` Every render without `useCallback` creates a **new function reference**, triggering unnecessary updates in children wrapped with `React.memo`. By stabilizing the reference, you keep your component tree efficient and predictable. ### Why This Is Better * Without useCallback, handleToggle is recreated on every render. * That means every TodoItem (even unchanged ones) would re-render unnecessarily, because their onToggle prop changed identity. * With useCallback, the function reference is stable, and React.memo can correctly skip re-renders. In large lists or UIs with lots of child components, this has a huge performance impact. The take away, useCallback in child components. Noticeable when their parents are `React.memo` components. This could 10x UIs that rely on heavy nesting. # useRef: The \"Don't touch my SH!T\" hook `useRef` isn’t just for grabbing DOM elements, though admittedly that is how I use it 9/10 times. It can store **mutable values** that persist across renders without causing re-renders. Read that again, because you probably don't get how awesome that is. ``` const renderCount = useRef(0); renderCount.current++; ``` This is useful for things like: * Tracking render counts (for debugging) * Storing timers or subscriptions * Holding previous state values ``` const prevValue = useRef(value); useEffect(() =&gt; { prevValue.current = value; }, [value]); ``` Now `prevValue.current` always holds the **previous** value, a pattern often overlooked but extremely handy. # useDeferredValue: The \"I'm on my way\" hook For modern, data-heavy apps, `useDeferredValue` (React 18+) allows you to keep UI snappy while deferring heavy updates. ``` const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(searchQuery); const filtered = useMemo(() =&gt; filterLargeList(deferredQuery), [deferredQuery]); ``` React will render the UI instantly, while deferring non-urgent updates until the main thread is free, a subtle UX upgrade that users **definitely feel**. # useTransition: The \"I'll tell you when I am ready\" hook `useTransition` helps you mark state updates as non-urgent. It’s a game-changer for transitions like filters, sorting, or route changes that take noticeable time. ``` const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition(); function handleSortChange(sortType) { startTransition(() =&gt; { setSort(sortType); }); } ``` This keeps the UI responsive by allowing React to render updates gradually, showing loading indicators only when needed. # Bonus: useImperativeHandle for Library Builders like me! If you build reusable components or libraries, `useImperativeHandle` lets you expose **custom methods** to parent components through refs. ``` import React, { forwardRef, useRef, useImperativeHandle, useState, } from \"react\"; const Form = forwardRef((props, ref) =&gt; { const [name, setName] = useState(\"\"); const [email, setEmail] = useState(\"\"); // Expose methods to the parent via ref useImperativeHandle(ref, () =&gt; ({ reset: () =&gt; { setName(\"\"); setEmail(\"\"); }, getValues: () =&gt; ({ name, email }), validate: () =&gt; name !== \"\" &amp;&amp; email.includes(\"@\"), })); return ( &lt;form className=\"flex flex-col gap-2\"&gt; &lt;input value={name} onChange={(e) =&gt; setName(e.target.value)} placeholder=\"Name\" /&gt; &lt;input value={email} onChange={(e) =&gt; setEmail(e.target.value)} placeholder=\"Email\" /&gt; &lt;/form&gt; ); }); export default function ParentComponent() { const formRef = useRef(); const handleSubmit = () =&gt; { if (formRef.current.validate()) { console.log(\"Form values:\", formRef.current.getValues()); alert(\"Submitted!\"); formRef.current.reset(); } else { alert(\"Please enter a valid name and email.\"); } }; return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;Form ref={formRef} /&gt; &lt;button onClick={handleSubmit} className=\"mt-4 bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded\"&gt; Submit &lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); } ``` This allows clean control over internal component behavior while keeping a tidy API surface. Hope you enjoyed the read! I am trying to be more helpful to the community and post more educational things, lessons learned, etc. Let me know if you think this is helpful to this sub! :)",

Im not so sure this is a great idea.. I would rather write frontend in bit more traditional way, for exempel NextJS, Angular or Nuxt (Something built in JS). I want the frontend to be as thin as possible (separate designsystem for accessable, resposive style) with dedicated services (.NET,REST) which knows more about the business, while the outermost presentation knowing less.. But In not very sure the others Will se why layering like this would be a good thing. What do you guys think? Should I embrace Blazor for the good of the team or should i stand my ground and choose React/Vue/Angular, because i think its a better choice in the long run?",

      "content": "I'm excited to share a project I created to solve a problem of orchestrating long-running, multi-step asynchronous processes. Flowcraft is a lightweight, dependency-free workflow engine that lets you define your logic as a graph (a DAG) and handles the execution, state management, and error handling. Here are some of the key ideas: * **Powers Visual UIs:** Because workflows are just JSON data, you can easily build a visual editor on the frontend. It ships with a `.toGraphRepresentation()` utility to generate a clean data structure, which you can feed directly into libraries like **xyflow** to create your own \"Zapier-like\" UI. * **Pluggable and Unopinionated:** The core is just a simple engine. Don't like the default JSON serializer? Plug in your own. Need to wrap every step in a DB transaction? Write a middleware. Want to use a specific expression engine for conditional logic? Implement the `IEvaluator` interface. It’s designed to be a flexible part of your existing stack. * **Seamless Scaling with Adapters:** This is the feature I'm most proud of. You can write your workflow logic once and run it in a single Node.js process. If you ever need to scale out, you can add a distributed adapter for systems like **BullMQ (Redis), Kafka, or RabbitMQ**, and your workflow will run across a fleet of workers. Your business logic doesn't have to change at all. * **First-Class Testing Tools:** It ships with a testing package that includes an `InMemoryEventLogger` (a \"flight recorder\" for your workflows) and a `createStepper` function. The stepper lets you execute your graph one step at a time, making it incredibly easy to debug complex flows or write fine-grained integration tests. It's MIT licensed and I'd love for the JS community to take a look and give me your thoughts. * **Docs &amp; Live Demos:** [`flowcraft.js.org`](http://flowcraft.js.org) * **GitHub:** [`github.com/gorango/flowcraft`](http://github.com/gorango/flowcraft)",
